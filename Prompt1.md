You are a professional B2B website strategist and copywriter.

We are upgrading an existing static outsourcing/business resource website to make it suitable for real business deployment.

Do NOT redesign everything from scratch. Improve the existing structure professionally.

OBJECTIVE:
Rewrite and restructure the homepage to:
- Be client-focused (not generic)
- Clearly state value proposition
- Improve clarity and authority
- Add strong primary CTA
- Maintain a clean corporate tone

CONSTRAINTS:
- Static website (HTML/CSS only)
- Professional B2B outsourcing positioning
- Target: Businesses needing staffing/support services
- Tone: Confident, credible, not exaggerated
- No hype language

OUTPUT STRUCTURE:

1. New Hero Section
   - Headline (pain → solution)
   - Subheadline
   - Primary CTA text
   - Secondary CTA text

2. Short Credibility Section
   - 3 bullet points explaining why clients should trust us

3. Services Summary Section
   - 4–6 services
   - Each with short benefit-driven description (2–3 lines)

4. “How It Works” Section
   - 4-step structured process
   - Clear and simple

5. Strong Closing CTA Section

Make everything cohesive and structured for implementation.

Do not generate code yet. Generate content structure only.
