We are now restructuring the website from a simple landing page into a professional multi-section business website.

Using the previously defined homepage content and design system, create the full website structure.

OBJECTIVE:
Define a professional site map and page layout structure.

CREATE:

1. Navigation Structure
   - Home
   - Services
   - About Us
   - Careers
   - Contact
   - Privacy Policy
   - Terms

2. Page Breakdown

For each page define:
- Purpose
- Sections included
- Key content elements
- CTA placement

Ensure:
- Content stays consistent with homepage messaging
- Tone remains professional B2B
- No contradictions from previous prompts

Output structured blueprint only.
